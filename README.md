***READ ME***

# The purpose of this mini-project is to have a system set-up such that one can use a remote device to sleep a computer.

# Requirement
## I should see a webpage which tells me if the server is on or off. (find a way to serve the page without the server)
## If ON. I should see a button which allows me to Sleep the server. (feedback saying that the server is sleeping)

# Will it be possible to wake up the system?
